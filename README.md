# Task: Create a RESTful API for Todo List Application

The task involves creating a RESTful API to manage a simple todo list application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. The application should allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items, each of which should have a title and a description. Hibernate is used to persist the items in a MySQL database.

## Task Completion Process

### Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
- Completing the task with AI was relatively straightforward. The AI provided code snippets and guidance for setting up a Spring Boot application with Hibernate, which significantly reduced the development time.

### How long did the task take to complete?
- The task took approximately 30 minutes to complete. This includes reading and understanding the generated code, making minor adjustments, and setting up the database.

### Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
- The code generated by AI was mostly ready to run. However, there were a few configurations that needed to be adjusted to make it usable. These adjustments included setting up the MySQL database connection, adding necessary dependencies to the `pom.xml` file, and making some minor code adjustments to match specific requirements.

### Which challenges did you face during the completion of the task?
- The main challenge faced during the completion of the task was configuring the PostgresSQL database connection. This involved setting up the database, providing the correct credentials, and ensuring that the application connected to the database successfully. Additionally, some troubleshooting was required to resolve any errors related to the database.

### Which specific prompts did you learn as good practice to complete the task?
- The AI provided helpful prompts and code snippets for setting up a Spring Boot project, including creating the necessary classes for the todo list application. The prompts also guided the process of defining the model, repository, and controller classes for handling todo items.

In summary, using AI for this task was beneficial as it significantly accelerated the initial setup of the Spring Boot application, but some additional manual configuration and troubleshooting were required to make the code fully functional. The generated code provided a solid foundation for building the RESTful API for the todo list application.
